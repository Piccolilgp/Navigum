Hello friends!

This is my very first game in python, called "Navigum". 
I spent three days building this game and I hope you guys like it. 
Feel free to share your opinions about it, I'd like to hear you all. 
The name of the music that is playing on game is "Bloody Tears" from Castlevania: Symphony of the Night game. I dont' own it's rights.

The "dist" folder has an .exe file of the game.

Useful commands for Navigum:

Enter: Start the game.
P: Pause/Play the game.
S: Turn sounds on/off.
M: Turn on/off the music.
Space: Shoot.
Arrow keys: Move the spaceship.
